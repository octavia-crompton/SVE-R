\section{Introduction}

This model couples two pre-existing models: a 2D SVE solver [\textit{Bradford and Katopodes}, 1999] and a 1D Richards equation solver [\textit{Celia et al.}, 1990].	
The SVE solver uses a finite volume method involving two steps, predictor and corrector, to achieve second order accuracy.  The SVE model is coupled at each grid cell and timestep to the Richards equation solver.
The core of the model is implemented in Fortran  (\code{dryR.for}), and Python  scripts are provided to write and read the Fortran files.
 
This document is divided into the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Section \ref{SVE}: A brief summary of the Saint Venant and Richards Equations.
	\item Section \ref{SVE_solver}:  An overview the SVE-R numerical methods, and how the two model components are coupled. 
%	\item  Infiltration and flow resistance are represented in the source term $Q$.
	\item Section 3: An overview of the Python wrapper scripts,  which write the Fortran input files, compile and execute the Fortran code, and read and visualize the Fortran outputs. 
	\item  Additional Python code: a stand-alone Richards solver 
	\item  Additional Python code: an implementation of \citet{GW1996}.
\end{itemize}		

\section{Background: Equations and Numerical Methods }
\label{SVE}

\subsection{The 2D Saint Venant Equations}
The SVE are written in integral form:

\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_\Omega \mathbf{U} d\Omega + \oint_\partial (\mathbf{F} dy - \mathbf{G} dx ) = \int_\Omega \mathbf{Q} d\Omega
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{U}^T = (h, hU, hV) $ is the vector of conservative variables. 


\[ \mathbf{F} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	h U  \\
	h U^2 + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \\
	h U V \\
\end{bmatrix}  ; \quad
\mathbf{G} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	h V \\
	h U V \\
	h V^2 + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \\	
\end{bmatrix}  
\]

where $h$ is the flow depth,  $z$ is the bed elevation, $u$ and $v$ are the vertically averaged velocities in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. 
The source terms are defined as:


 \[ \mathbf{Q} = 
%\begin{bmatrix}
%	 - i  \\[.1cm]
%	- g h \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} - c_D U \sqrt{U^2 + V^2} - \frac{ui}{2}\\[.1cm]
%	- g h \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} - c_D V \sqrt{U^2 + V^2} - \frac{vi}{2}\\[.1cm]
%\end{bmatrix}  = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
	p - i  \\[.1cm]
	- g h \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial x} - g h  S_{f,x} + \dfrac{u(p-i)}{2}\\[.1cm]
	- g h \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial y} - g h  S_{f,y} + \dfrac{v(p-i)}{2}\\[.1cm]
\end{bmatrix} 
\]

%where the first term shows the \textit{Bradford and Katopodes} (1999) source term, and the second term shows the modified version.
% $c_D$ is the bottom drag coefficient, and $c_D = g n^2 /h^{1/3}$ for Manning's equation. 
where $p$ is the rainfall rate,   $i$ is the infiltration rate of water into the bed, and $S_{f,x}$ and $S_{f,y}$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the friction slope. 



\subsection{SVE numerical methods}

 The model is adapted from  \textit{Bradford and Katopodes} (1999), referred to here as BK, 
  and uses predictor-corrector time-stepping to provide a second-order accurate solution.
 The only significant difference between the BK model and the model described here is the coupling to a Richards equation solver.  The following summary of the numerical methods is adapted from \textit{Bradford and Katopodes} (1999), where a better and more complete explanation can be found. 
  
  A predictor is computed at  time level $n + 1/2$ by solving the primitive equations in generalized coordinates, and a corrector is computed at the $n + 1$ time level by solving the integral equations.  
   
 \subsubsection*{Predictor Step}

 The predictor solution is computed by solving the equations in primitive form. In generalized coordinates:

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial t} + 
	\mathbf{A}_W	\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial \xi} + 
	\mathbf{B}_W	\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial \eta} =
	\mathbf{Q}_W
\label{predictor}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\xi$ and $\eta$ are in the directions of increasing $j$ and $k$ indices, respectively.
The  $j$,$k$ indices indicate the column and row numbers of a given cell, respectively (see Figure \ref{coords} schematic).
$\mathbf{W_T} = [h, U, V]$ is the array of primitive variables, and the matrices $\mathbf{A}_W$ and $\mathbf{B}_W$ are defined as:

\[ \mathbf{A}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\xi} & h \xi_x & h \xi_{y} \\
    g \xi_x &    U_{\xi}  & 0    \\
    g \xi_y &   0   & U_{\xi}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{B}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\eta} & h \eta_x    & h \eta_{y} \\
    g \eta_x &    U_{\eta}  & 0    \\
    g \eta_y &      0       & U_{\eta}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} 		
\]	


\noindent where $U_{\xi} = U \xi_x  + V \xi_y $ and $U_{\eta} = U \eta_x  + V \eta_y $.
$\xi_x$,  $\xi_y$,  $\eta_x$ and  $\eta_y$ are the grid transformation metrics for mapping $x$ and $y$ to $\xi$ and  $\eta$. In Cartesian coordinates, the generalized coordinates simplify to: $\xi  = x$ and  $\eta  = y$.

The predictor solution in cell $j$, $k$ at $t + \Delta t/2$  is given as:

 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{W}_{j,k}^{n+1/2} = \mathbf{W}_{j,k}^{n}
- \frac{\Delta t}{2} (
	\mathbf{A}_W \overline{\Delta \mathbf{W}}_\xi+
	\mathbf{B}_W \overline{\Delta \mathbf{W}}_\eta-
	\mathbf{Q}_W)_{j,k}^{n+1/2}
\label{predictor}
\end{equation}


\noindent where the overbar denotes a cell-average gradient of $\mathbf{W}$ in cell $j$, $k$,  which is computed with a flux limiter (nonlinear average) in order to preserve solution monotonicity.  Flux limiters  become first-order accurate near discontinuities while remaining second-order accurate elsewhere, and several options are included in the code, described in Section \ref{SVE_solver}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=15pc]{grid/coords.png}
 \caption{Sketch of a computational cell, after BK Figure 2.}
 \label{coords}
 \end{figure}
  

 \subsubsection*{Corrector Step}
 
 The corrector solution is obtained from the conservative form of the governing equations.
 
 The predictor solutions are reconstructed to the left and right of each cell face using the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL), which achieves second-order spatial accuracy.  The reconstructed predictor values define a Reimann problem at each cell face, which are used to compute the interfacial fluxes:
 
\begin{equation} \nonumber
	\dfrac{\mathbf{U}_{j,k}^{n+1} -\mathbf{U}_{j,k}^{n}}{\Delta t} 
	+ \dfrac{1}{\Omega_{j,k}} \big[ 
		- \mathbf{F}_{\perp 1}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_1
		+ \mathbf{F}_{\perp 2}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_2
		+ \mathbf{F}_{\perp 3}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_3
		- \mathbf{F}_{\perp 4}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_4		
	\big] = \mathbf{Q}^{n+1/2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ are the cell-center values in cell $j,k$ with area $\Omega$, $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ are the average boundary values on each cell face, and $\delta s$ is the length of the cell faces.
The indices 1 through 4 denote the four cell faces: index 1 corresponds to the bottom cell face, and the remaining cell faces are numbered in counter-clockwise order.

The flux $\mathbf{F}$  is normal to the cell boundary and positive in the direction of increasing cell coordinates.  $\mathbf{F}$  is defined as:

\[ \mathbf{F}_\perp = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    h u_\perp \\[0.1cm]
    h u u_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \cos \phi   \\[0.1cm]
    h v u_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \sin \phi   \\[0.1cm]    
\end{bmatrix}  		
\]	

where $u_\perp$ is the velocity perpendicular to the cell face, and $\phi$ is the angle between the face normal vector and the $x$-axis.

The fluxes are evaluated using a Godunov-type upwind scheme in which a Riemann problem is solved across each cell face, using the method of Roe (1981).  Further details can be found in BK. 
%The scheme is summarized with the equation:
%
%\begin{equation} 
%\mathbf{F}_{\perp I} = \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{F}_{\perp L} + \mathbf{F}_{\perp R }- \mathbf{\hat{R}} |\mathbf{\hat{\Lambda}} |\mathbf{\Delta \hat{V}}  )
%\label{riemann}
%\end{equation}
%where the subscript $I$ denotes the interface between two adjacent cells, and the subscripts $L$ and $R$ refer to the left and right sides of the interface.  $\Delta$ is the finite difference across the cell interface. 

% Predicted values to the left and right of each face in a cell are first reconstructed, i.e. at the right cell face:
% \begin{equation}
% \mathbf{W}_{j+1/2,k}^{n+1/2L}  = \mathbf{W}_{j,k}^{n+1/2L} + \frac{1}{2} \overline{\Delta W_\xi}|_{j,k}^n
%  \end{equation}

% The fluxes are computed with Roe’s approximate Riemann solver and the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws.
% 
%
%The flux $\mathbf{F}_\perp$ is positive in the direction of increasing computational coordinates, normal to the cell boundary, and described as: 
%
%\[ \mathbf{F}_\perp = 
%\begin{bmatrix}
%	 \code{h $U_\perp$} \\
%	 \code{h U U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \cos \phi} \\
%	 \code{h V U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \sin \phi} \\
%\end{bmatrix} 
% =  {
%	 \begin{bmatrix}
%	 \code{h U_\perp} \\
%	 \code{h U U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \cos \phi} \\
%	 \code{h V U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \sin \phi} \\
%\end{bmatrix} 
%}  \]
%
%where $U_\perp$ (\code{uperp}) is the velocity perpendicular to the cell face, and 


\subsubsection*{The source term }

The source term $\mathbf{Q}$ contains the parameterization of the surface roughness (via the friction slope $S_f$  and the lateral inputs (rainfall $p$ and infiltration $i$).  Infiltration is independently modeled at each timestep and grid cell with the 1D Richards equation, described in the next subsection.
  
 The friction slope is specified in the generalized form: 

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_{f,x} = \bigg( \dfrac{\alpha  U}{h^m}\bigg)^{1/\eta} \dfrac{|U|}{U}; \quad
S_{f,y} = \bigg( \dfrac{\alpha  V}{h^m}\bigg)^{1/\eta} \dfrac{|U|}{V}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $\alpha$ is a  roughness parameter, and $m$ specifies the flow regime ($m=2$ for laminar flow, 1/2 for turbulent flow).   $\eta$=1/2 for most roughness schemes, with the exception of laminar flow, for which $\eta$=1.  For Manning's equation, $\alpha = n$, $m=2/3$ and $\eta=1/2$:

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_{f,x} =  \dfrac{n^2 U}{h^{4/3}} |U|; \quad
S_{f,y} = \dfrac{n^2 V}{h^{4/3}} |U|
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent More generally, with $\eta=1/2$:
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_{f,x} = \dfrac{\alpha^2 }{h^m}  U |U|; \quad
S_{f,y} = \dfrac{\alpha^2 }{h^m} V |U|
\end{eqnarray}


\subsubsection*{Richards equation}

Richards equation is solved following the approach outlined by \textit{Celia et al.} (1990), which involves a backward Euler approximation in time coupled with a simple Picard iteration scheme.  
The solver used the discrete approximation of the  mixed $H$-$\theta$ form: 

\begin{equation} 
	\dfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot K \nabla H - \dfrac{\partial K}{\partial z} = 0
\label{richards}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $z$ denotes the vertical dimension (assumed positive upwards),  $\theta$ is the soil moisture content, $H$ is the matric potential and $K$ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.
 $\theta$ and matric potential $H$ are related via the Van Genuchten water retention curve. The volumetric soil moisture content, $\theta$, and effective saturation, $S_e$, are computed as:

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
\theta = \dfrac{\theta_S – \theta_R}{1 + (\alpha|H|)^n)^m} + \theta_R
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_e = \dfrac{\theta – \theta_R}{\theta_S – \theta_R}
\end{eqnarray}

 where $\theta_S$ and  $\theta_R$ are the saturated and residual soil moisture content; $n$ is a measure of the pore size distribution;$m=(1-1/n)$; and $\alpha$  is related to the inverse of the air entry suction.  The unhydraulic conductivity $K$ is computed as:

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
K = K_s \sqrt{S_e} [1 – (1 – S_e^{1/m})^m]^2
\end{eqnarray}

where $K_s$ is the saturated hydraulic conductivity.
The infiltration rate is solved with Darcy's law:

\begin{equation}
q =-  K \bigg(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial z} + 1\bigg)
\label{darcy}
\end{equation}

where the 1  (second term) on the RHS of Equation \ref{darcy} reflects the fact that $H$ is the matric head, as opposed to the hydraulic head.

%Equation \ref{richards} is approximated as:
%\begin{equation} 
%	\dfrac{\theta^{n+1,m+1} - \theta^{n}} {\Delta t}  - \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \bigg( K^{n+1, m} 	\dfrac{\partial H^{n+1,m+1}} {\partial z}  \bigg) - 	\dfrac{\partial K^{n+1,m}} {\partial z}  = 0
%\label{celia14}
%\end{equation}
%
% where $n$ represents the time level and $m$ represents the iteration level  (note: the conflicting $n$ and $m$ in equation \ref{celia14} follow \textit{Celia et al.} (1990)).
% 

\subsubsection*{Coupling the SVE and Richards Equation models}

The model components are coupled at each grid cell in two steps: the depth from the SVE solver provides the surface boundary condition to the Richards equation solver, and the infiltration rate from the Richards equation solver is used by the SVE source term. This requires that several cases be accounted for: (1) no rain and no ponding, (2) rain but no ponding, and (3)  ponding (with or without rain).   In case (1), a no flux boundary condition is applied at the surface.
 In case (2), the Richards equation solver computes a potential infiltration rate ($PI$), defined as the infiltration rate that would occur with $H=0
 $ cm at the surface, and compares this value to the rainfall intensity, $p$.  If $p$ exceeds the potential infiltration rate, ponding begins and the  boundary condition switches to case (3).  Otherwise, the potential infiltration rate is greater than $p$, and $i=p$. Finally, in case (3), the upper boundary condition $H$ is equal to the ponding depth $h$.  These cases are schematically illustrated in Figure \ref{richardgrid}.
 
 	
 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{grid/richards.png}
 \caption{Schematic to illustrate the boundary condition cases for Richards equation. $PI$ is the potential infiltration rate, which is computed to determine whether the rain intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil (in which case ponding occurs).}
 \label{richardgrid}
 \end{figure}	



\section{SVE-R model Fortran code}
\label{SVE_solver}

\subsection{SVE-R model structure}


The model is written in Fortran, and located in the file \code{dry.f}.


Figure \ref{summary} summarizes the structure of \code{dry.f} (see Appendix C for a pseudocode summary).

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=30pc]{grid/summary.png}
 \caption{Summary of the SVE-R model structure in \code{dry.f}.}
 \label{summary}
 \end{figure}


\code{dry.f} is initialized with files located in the input folder, and saves all outputs to the output folder.  
Common variables are specified in \code{dry.inc} (a number of variables are ``common" variables, and not explicitly returned by the Fortran subroutines). 


\subsection{Initializing the SVE solver}
\label{SVEinit}
	
The \code{init} subroutine initializes the SVE component of the model,  which involves reading a number of scalar parameters from  \code{params.dat} (see Appendix B) and setting up the grid.
 The infiltration and parameters  are initialized in the subroutine \code{initVG}).  The following subsections  include all of the input files, and further details about each input file.  The grid-specific input files are illustrated for a 2$\times$2 grid, where the boundaries are:   a fixed-flux subcritical boundary at the top of the hill, closed/wall lateral boundaries, and an open boundary at the bottom of the hill. Figure \ref{grid2by2} introduces the 2x2 grid used to explain the grid set-up.  Note that, while the SVE-R model Fortran code does not assume a  rectangular grid, the provided Python code and sample input files do assume a rectangular grid.

 \caption{Summary of the SVE-R model structure.}
 \label{grid2by2}
 \end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Input files}
\begin{itemize}

	\item \code{params.dat} : \code{params.dat} specifies a number of scalar parameters, and is read by the \code{init} subroutine of \code{dry.for}.  See Appendix for a list of the input parameters and sample \code{params.dat} file.

	\item \code{coords.dat} : contains the $x$,$y$,$z$ coordinates at the cell nodes.

	\item \code{boundary.dat}: Describes the boundary types and locations.

	\item \code{veg.dat} : Contains vegetation pattern. Written by \code{input\_veg.py}. 

	\item \code{nodes.dat} : Numbered list of the nodes surrounding each grid cell.

	\item \code{vanG.dat} : Van Genuchten parameters and initial H as a function of depth for vegetated and bare soil cells. 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\code{coords.dat}}
\code{coords.dat}  The first line contains the number of points (\code{npt = (ncol+1)*(nrow+1)})  and the number of cell edges (\code{ne = nrow*ncol}). 
 
 
\subsubsection*{\code{boundary.dat}}
 
 The first row contains the number of boundary cells, defined as a grid cell with one or more boundaries.
 
 columns are \code{j k inum itype ipos}.
 
 \code{input\_boundary.py} loops over all of the boundary cells, and records the boundary location \code{j,k}, number \code{inum}, type \code{itype}, and position \code{ipos}.  
 Following this, 
 the following rows record: 
 the number of columns and rows, and, for each column, 
 the beginning and final row  (i.e. \code{kbeg = 1} and \code{kend = nrow}.
  
Boundary types are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \code{itype} = 1 for a closed boundary
	\item  \code{itype} = 0 for an open boundary
	\item  \code{itype} = 4 for a subcritical fixed flux boundary.\end{itemize}
 
  For subcritical fixed flux boundary,  the normal depth is computed  with Manning's equation with $n=0.1$.  
The input parameter \code{influx} is specified in unis m$^2$/s.
 
 The rainfall rate (in cm/hr) can be related to \code{influx} as:
$p$ (cm/hr) = $q$ (m$^2$/s)*3600 s/hr /(Ly m) * 100 cm/m
 or $q$*3.6e5/$L_y$ 
 
 Equivalent \code{influx} is $p*Ly/3.6e5$ = equivalent $q$ (m\^2/s)



\subsubsection*{Grid Set-up}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{nn} : space allocated to grid (\code{nn>np}).
	\item  \code{np}:  the number of nodes. 
	\item \code{x(nn), y(nn), zz(nn)} : $x,y,z$ coordinates of the cell nodes.  \\[0.1cm]
		\code{x,y,zz} are read as 1D arrays, and interpolated to a 2D grid with the help of the nodes file \code{nodes.dat}.
		\item  \code{xc, yc, zc} : coordinates at the cell centers, with dimensions (ncol, nrow)
		
	\item  \code{dxi} = $d\xi$, \quad  $\code{dxi(1)},\code{dxi(2)} =   \xi_x, \xi_y $
	\item  \code{deta} =  $d\eta$ \quad  $\code{deta(1)},\code{deta(2)} =   \eta_x, \eta_y $

	\item \code{sx} = $\dfrac{dz}{dx}$,  \code{sy} =  $\dfrac{dz}{dy}$
	\item \code{nop(nx,ny,4)} : node numbers defining each grid cell (see Figure \ref{nodes}).  

	\item \code{inum} : number of boundary interfaces of each grid cell.
	\item \code{itype} :  interface type of each boundary (\code{itype} = 1 for wall boundaries, 0 for open boundaries,..).  
	\item \code{ipos} :  Position of each boundary, with dimensions (ncol, nrow, 4)
\end{itemize}

 \label{nodes}
 \end{figure}
 



\subsubsection*{2x2 Grid example}

\code{nop(1,1,:) = [1,4,5,2]} means that cell (1,1) is bounded by nodes \code{n1=1,n2=4,n3=5,n4=2}, starting from the lower left node \code{n1} moving counterclockwise.
 \code{itype(j,k,2)=1, itype(j,k,3)=4}, means that cell \code{(j,k)} has a closed boundary at position 2 (right) and a subcritical influx boundary at position 3 (top). See Figure	 \ref{nodes}.			
	 


%
%$$ U_\xi = \code{uxi} ,  \quad U_\eta = \code{ueta} $$
%




vertical cell faces have index 1,
horizontal faces have index 2

%\code{ds(j,k,2)} : area of the lower horizontal boundary of cell \code{j,k} (\code{ipos = 1}), in m$^2$.

\subsection{The predictor step}

The \code{predict} subroutine is called for each cell to obtain \code{hp}, \code{up},  \code{vp} (corresponding to $h^{n+1/2}$,$u^{n+1/2}$,$v^{n+1/2}$).   \code{predict}  modifies the common variables  \code{hp}, \code{up},  \code{vp}, \code{dh}, \code{du}, \code{dv}, \code{qs}.


The following provides an (incomplete) correspondence between BK equations and Fortran code, with the mathematical notation in \textit{italics} and the equivalent code in \code{typewriter}.   For example, for the array of primitive variables:
\[  \mathbf{W_T} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	h \\
	U \\
	V \\
\end{bmatrix}
 =  {
	 \begin{bmatrix}
	 \code{h} \\
	 \code{u} \\	 
	 \code{v} \\	 	 	 
\end{bmatrix} 
}  \]



The matrices $\mathbf{A}_W$ and $\mathbf{B}_W$ are defined as: 

\[ \mathbf{A}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\xi} & h \xi_x & h \xi_{y} \\
    g \xi_x &    U_{\xi}  & 0    \\
    g \xi_y &   0   & U_{\xi}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \code{ uxi }& \code{h} \ \code{dxi(1)} &\code{h*dxi(2)}\\
    \code{g dxi(1)}& \code{uxi} & 0  \\    
    \code{g dxi(2)}&     0       & \code{uxi}  \\          
\end{bmatrix} 
\]

\[ \mathbf{B}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\eta} & h \eta_x    & h \eta_{y} \\
    g \eta_x &    U_{\eta}  & 0    \\
    g \eta_y &      0       & U_{\eta}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \code{ ueta }  & \code{h*deta(1) } & \code{ h*deta(2)}\\
    \code{g dxi(1)} & \code{ueta}  & 0  \\    
    \code{g dxi(2)} &     0  	   &  \code{ueta}  \\          
\end{bmatrix} 
\]


\[ \partial_\xi \mathbf{W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}

where  \code{dh(1)} implies \code{dh(j,k,1)}, and similarly for  \code{du(1)} and  \code{dv(1)}. 

$ \mathbf{A}_w \partial_\xi \mathbf{W} $ is computed as:

\[ \mathbf{A}_w \partial_\xi \mathbf{W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\xi} & h \xi_x & h \xi_{y}  \\
    g \xi_x &    U_{\xi}  & 0   \\
    g \xi_y &   0   & U_{\xi}    \\

\begin{bmatrix}

	  g \xi_y  \partial_\xi h  +  U_{\xi}  \partial_\xi v  \\	 	 
\end{bmatrix} 
 \]

Equivalently in code:

\begin{equation*}\label{theta-alt}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}_w \partial_\xi \mathbf{W}  &=
 \begin{bmatrix}
     \code{uxi} & \code{h dxi(1)} & \code{h  dxi(2) } \\
     \code{g dxi(1)} & \code{uxi} &  0  \\     
     \code{g dxi(2)} & 0 &  \code{uxi}  \\

	   \code{g*dxi(2)*dh(1)  + uxi*du(1) } \\ 	 	 	 	 	   
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}



The \code{limitr} subroutine contains the flux limiter that the predictor step uses to compute the cell-average spatial gradients (which preserves solution monotonicity by becoming first-order accurate near discontinuities, yet remains second-order accurate elsewhere).
Various choices are included, with the parameter \code{ilim} specifying the averaging type. \code{ilim}=5 instructs the code to use the $\beta$ family of averages, and is given by:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\mathbf{\overline{\Delta W}} = \text{sign}(a)\text{min}[\text{max}(|a|, |b|), \beta(|a|, |b|)]  \textmd{ if }  ab>0  \\ 
	0 \textmd{ if }  ab \leq 0	
\end{eqnarray*}

$\beta$ = 1 yields the relatively more dissipative Minmod average, and $\beta $ = 2 yields the less dissipative Superbee average. 


\subsection{Corrector step}

The corrector step computes the fluxes between the cell interfaces by calling the \code{fluxes} subroutine for each cell \code{j,k} and for each interface. 

The interfacial cell fluxes at a given time-step are stored in the common variable \code{f(0:nx,0:ny,1:3,1:2)}, where the first two indices of \code{f} contain the $j,k$ coordinates, the third index correspond to the components of  $\mathbf{F_\perp}$ (see Equation), and the final index denotes the cell face (1 for vertical cell faces and 2 for horizontal).   
\code{f(j,k,1:3,1)} represents the flux from cell $(j-1, k)$ to $(j, k)$, and
\code{f(j,k,1:3,2)} represents the flux from cell $(j, k-1)$ to $(j, k)$ (see Figure \ref{fluxes_specific}).
Calling \code{fluxes(j-1,j,k,k,1)} modifies \code{f(j,k,1:3,1)}  and calling \code{fluxes(j,j,k-1,k,2)} \code{f(j,k,1:3,2)}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=15pc]{grid/fluxes_specific.png}
 \caption{Definitional sketch for the interfacial fluxes, indicating how the fluxes into and out of cell (j,k) are stored in the array \code{f(0:nx,0:ny,1:3,1:2)}}.
 \label{fluxes_specific.png}
 \end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Fluxes subroutine}

Within the \code{fluxes} subroutine, \code{fluxes(jl,jr,kl,kr,i1)} computes the flux from cell \code{(jl,kl)} to \code{(jr,kr)}, modifying the common variable \code{f(jr,kr,1:3,i1)}. 
\code{i1 = 1} indicates that the flux is between vertical cell faces, i.e. from cell \code{(j-1,k)} to \code{(j,k)}.
Similarly, \code{i1 = 2} indicates that the flux is between horizontal cell faces, i.e. from cell \code{(j,k-1)} to \code{(j,k)}.

 
\code{fluxes}  first reconstructs the predicted values to the left and right of each face (\code{hl,hr,ul, ur,vl,vr)} using the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL).  These reconstructed predictor values define a Riemann problem at each cell face, and \code{fluxes} calls the \code{solver} subroutine to compute $\mathbf{F_{\perp I}}$ from Equation \ref{riemann}, reproduced below:

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{F_{\perp I}} =
	 \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{F_{\perp L}} + \mathbf{F_{\perp R}} - \mathbf{\hat{R} |\hat{\Lambda}| \Delta \hat V  })
\end{equation*}

%% equations from BK are reproduced here in order to relate these equations to  the Fortran code.t

\subsubsection*{Solver subroutine}

This subroutine uses the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL) to compute $\mathbf{F_\perp}$ at each cell face.  The code in \code{solver} corresponds to the Equation \ref{riemann} as: 

 \begin{itemize}
 	\item $\mathbf{\hat{R}}$ : \code{e(3,3)}
 	\item $\mathbf{|\hat{\Lambda}|}$ : \code{a(3) }x
 	\item $\mathbf{ \Delta \hat V  }  $ : \code{ws(3)} 
 \end{itemize}
 
 \[ \mathbf{\hat{R}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &  0  & 1  \\
    \hat{u} -\hat{a} \cos{\phi} &   -\sin{\phi} & \hat{u} +\hat{a} \cos{\phi}   \\
    \hat{v} -\hat{a} \sin{\phi} &   \cos{\phi} & \hat{v} +\hat{a} \sin{\phi}    \\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &  0  & 1  \\
    \code{uhat-chat*cndum} &    \code{-sndum} &  \code{uhat+chat*cndum} \\
    \code{vhat-chat*sndum} &    \code{cndum} &  \code{vhat+chat*sndum} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\
 
 \[ \mathbf{|\hat{\Lambda}|} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  |\hat{u}_\perp - \hat a| &  &  \\
     &   |\hat{u}_\perp | &  \\ 
     & &  |\hat{u}_\perp  + \hat a| \\
\end{bmatrix} \ =  \
\begin{bmatrix}
 \code{ |uperp - chat|} &  &  \\
     &    \code{ |uperp |} &  \\ 
     & &   \code{ |uperp + chat|} \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\]


 \[ \mathbf{\Delta \hat{V}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	\frac{1}{2} \bigg( \Delta h - \dfrac{\hat h \Delta u_{\perp} }{\hat a} +
	 \dfrac{\hat h \Delta c_T }{2  c_T}\bigg) \\[.2cm]

  \begin{itemize}
 	\item  $\Delta h$ : \code{dhdum = hr - hl } 
 	\item  Left interface:   \code{hl = hp(jl,kl) + 0.5*dh(i1)}
  	\item  Right interface:   \code{hr = hp(jl,kl) - 0.5*dh(i1)}
 \end{itemize}
 

\subsection{The \code{source} subroutine}

% Infiltration and surface resistance are represented in 
 The source term is computed with the subroutine \code{source}, which modifies the common variable \code{qs} (or $Q(j,k)$).
  \code{source} is called by both the predictor and corrector steps; however, Richards equation is only solved during corrector step. 
 The input arguments are the  cell indices \code{j,k}, the primitive variables, and an indicator variable \code{lstep} for the step type (\code{lstep = 0} for the predictor step and 1 for the corrector step.		
 
In the predictor step, \code{source} is called for each cell before updating the predictor values (\code{hp,up,vp}):
\begin{center}
\code{call source(j, k, h(j,k), u(j,k), v(j,k), 0)}
\end{center}

 
\code{source} is similarly  called in the corrector step before updating the fluxes: 
\begin{center}
\code{call source(j, k, hp(j,k), up(j,k), v[(j,k), 0)}
\end{center}

Inside \code{source}, the primitive variables are labeled \code{depth,udum,vdum}. 
The source term in Fortran code is given as:

\[ \mathbf{Q} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
	\code{winflt}  \\[.1cm]
	\code{-grav*depth*sx(j,k)-grav*depth*fricSx+0.5*udum*winflt}\\[.1cm]
	\code{-grav*depth*sy(j,k)-grav*depth*fricSy+0.5*vdum*winflt}\\[.1cm]
\end{bmatrix} 
\]

where $S_{f,x}$ = \code{fricSx} and  $S_{f,x}$ = \code{fricSy}, and $p-i$ = \code{winflt}.


\subsubsection*{Infiltration details (corrector-step)}

In the corrector step, \code{source} calls the infiltration-specific subroutines (\code{timestep} and \code{potential} to update the infiltration rate $i$ and the surface boundary conditions at cell \code{j,k}. 
%calls th subroutines (\code{potential} and \code{timestep}) to solve Richards equation. 
\code{timestep} solves Richards equation at cell \code{(j,k)} and returns the updated $H$, $\theta$ and $K$, which \code{source} uses to compute the infiltration rate $i$. \code{potential} is used to prescribe the boundary conditions. 

 The Richards equation solver is implemented separately for each grid cell, and the 3-dimensional $H$, $\theta$ and $K$  fields are saved as the common variables \code{r8H} (cm), \code{r8Theta}, and  \code{r8K} (cm/s), respectively, with dimensions (\code{nrow} $\times$ \code{ncol} $\times$ \code{nz}).\\ 

%%%% ADD POTENTIAL INFILTRATION


\noindent From Darcy's law, the infiltration rate $i$ (cm/s) is computed as:
$$ i =  K \bigg(\frac{\partial H}{\partial z} + 1\bigg ) $$
which corresponds to \code{r8kt*((hdum(nz)-hdum(nz-1))/dz+1)} in \code{source}.

\noindent  As an intermediate step, the depth is updated with: \\
\begin{center}
\code{znew=  zold + prate*100*dt - r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)*dt } 	
\end{center}
where \code{prate}  rainfall has been converted to cm/s.
 \code{winflt} = $p-i$  is then computed as:
\begin{center}
 \code{winflt = (znew - zold)/dt/100.} 	
\end{center}

%Note that \code{znew} is computed as a separate step for code readability, and things could be simplified to: \code{winflt = prate*100 - r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)} .
	
 



The  surface boundary condition cases are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  Case 1: Richards equation is solved every \code{iscale} timesteps. 
		  For all other SVE time steps, the infiltration rate is estimated as:
		  \begin{center}
			\code{r8kt*((hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1.d0)*dt} 		  	
		  \end{center}
			if the depth is greater than zero.   If depth = 0, q(s)=0, so that $p = i $ between Richards solver updates.  Ponding does not occur until the \code{potential} subroutine determines that the rainfall exceeds to potential infiltration rate ($p>PI$). 		
		
	\item Case 2: Rain and no ponding : \code{depth=0} and \code{prate > 0}. \\
		 The potential subroutine is called to estimate a potential infiltration rate $PI$, defined as the infiltration that would occur with $H=0$ at the surface (in cm/s). \\  
	    If the potential infiltration rate is less than the rainfall rate (\code{(PI .lt. prate*100)}), ponding begins.  In this case, the Richards boundary condition is switched to fixed $H$, and the timestep subroutine is called. 

	
\end{itemize}
	



\subsection{\code{timestep} The Richards equation subroutine }

Richards equation is solved by the \code{timestep} subroutine, which is called from \code{source}.
	
\subsubsection*{timestep inputs and outputs }
The inputs are \code{hnp1m, thetan}, which are the initial conditions to the Richards eqn solver (\code{hdum,thetadum} in the source subroutine, which calls \code{timestep}).  
The outputs are  \code{hnp1mp1,r8thetanp1m,r8knp1mp1}, which are  $H$, $\theta$ and $K$ at the following timestep (after dt\_r  time elapsed).


%$ i =  K (\frac{\partial H}{\partial z} + 1) $, which corresponds in the Fortran code to \code{ r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)}. 

When the soil is flagged as saturated,  the surface flux is set to $K$ at the surface, which should be very close to saturated (\code{flux  = - r8knp1m(nz)}).  This is achieved by adjusting the value of $H$ at node (nz-1):
\begin{center}
\code{hnp1mp1(nz-1) = hnp1mp1(nz) + dz + flux*dz/r8knp1m(nz-1)}	
\end{center}

Note: this approach should be treated with caution.  Is was designed for the use case of a fixed intensity rain storm, in which a uniform wetting front would arise.  It is not meant for variable rainfall cases.

\subsubsection*{Stop tolerance }
\code{stop\_tol0} is the stop tolerance specified in the input \code{params.dat}, with default value \code{stop\_tol0 = .01}.  
\code{stop\_tol} is reset to the original \code{stop\_tol0}  at the beginning of each Richards solver timestep.  The convergence tolerance  is relaxed if the Richards solver fails to converge within a specified number of iterations (default = 100).

%
%\subsubsection*{Common variables}
%\code{timestep} uses (but does not modify) several common variables including:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item  \code{nz} : the number of soil grid points.
%	\item \code{stop\_tol} : the stopping criteria in the Richards equation solver , for convergence of the solution)
%	\item \code{htop} is the surface boundary condition, as defined in source subroutine.
%\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection*{Potential infiltration}

The subroutine \code{potential} is used to compute the potential infiltration rate $PI$, defined as the infiltration that would be observed for a surface boundary condition of $H=0$. 
Potential infiltration is computed when there is rain but no ponding, and returns the potential infiltration rate, defined as the infiltration rate that would occur with $H=0$ at the surface.  

 
 \section{Running the model}

The Fortran code can be compiles from the terminal as
    \code{gFortran -o ./sw  -framework accelerate ./dry.for}
and executed as \code{.sw}, where \code{sw} is the name of the compiled executable.
  
   

\subsubsection*{input\_coords.py / wrap\_coords}

\code{sim\_input.py} calls \code{wrap\_coords} for each path / parameter case:
\begin{center}
	   \code{ wrap\_coords(path + '/input', params)}
\end{center}

 which calls the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{write\_nodes(path, ncol, nrow)  }: writes the cell node indices to \code{input/nodes.dat}.  
    This function assumes that the grid is rectangular, and would need to be modified for a non-rectangular grid. 
       It saves \code{nop}, which contains the indices of the nodes surrounding each cell face.
\item code{build\_coords(params)} : constructs the x,y,z fields. 
\end{itemize}


%
%\noindent Note: \code{coords.pklz} stores the cell center coordinates in a Python readable file, and is not a Fortran input file.




\subsection{Output files}
Output files are read by Python script \code{batch\_read.py}, using functions from \code{output\_dry.py}.  Most outputs are saved at intervals of  $dt\_p$, to limit the size of the output files.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{time.out} : file containing time, and max CFL number at each timestep.
	\item \code{h.out} : contains $h$,$U$, $V$,
	\item \code{summary.out} : summarizes ponding time, runtime, final time, and if applicable, the reason for an early exit (i.e. no more water, AMAX too big) 
	\item \code{hydro.out} : hydrograph at 1 second time resolution.  The hydrograph is saved by Fortran with m$^3$/s units,  and normalized by the hillslope dimensions to convert to cm/s in Python. Read by function \code{new\_hydro.out} in \code{output\_dry.py}.
	\item \code{dvol.out} :  output file to check mass balance. Read by function \code{get\_dvol} in \code{output\_dry.py}. See details below.

	\item \code{ptsTheta.out} (optional) : evolution of the soil moisture profiles at two points, one vegetated and one bare. 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{h.out}


Columns are
\begin{enumerate}
\item \code{j,k,h,u,v,zinflmap2, xflux0,yflux0,xflux1,yflux1}
\item Rhese variables are written for every grid cell in the domain (every j,k) every nprt timesteps.  Following, a line 
\item These variables are written to file when \code{myoutput} is called, nprt time steps.  
\item \code{zinflmap2} contains the total volume of water infilrated in cell j,k, and is reset to zero as soon as this variable is written to file. 
\end{enumerate} 

The Python function \code{get\_h} in \code{output\_dry.py} reads \code{h.out} and returns:
\code{h,u,v,inflVmap,xflux0,yflux0,xflux1,yflux1}, all with dimensions: \code{nprt x ncol x nrow}.  
Units are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{h} : m
	\item \code{u, v} : m/s
	\item \code{inflVmap} : cm m$^2$ (converted from Fortran m$^2$ )
	\item \code{xflux0, yflux0, xflux1, yflux1} : cm m$^2$ (converted from Fortran m$^2$ )
	       \subitem fluxes are positive directed out of the domain.
	
\end{itemize}


 \code{zinflc}: infiltration depth in cm


\subsubsection*{dvol.out}

Contains output from Fortran mass balance tracking.
Columns are \code{dvol, flux, infl,zain}  from Fortran mass tracking, containing the  change in surface volume, horizontal fluxes out of the domain, infiltration and rain volumes, respectively, in units m$^3$.

The Python function \code{get\_dvol} in \code{output\_dry.py} reads only the first three columns {dvol, flux, infl}, and the last is available for mass balance debugging.  \code{get\_dvol} normalizes by the domain area (Lx*Ly) and converts to cm.


\section{Python wrappers}

Python scripts generate the Fortran input files and read the Fortran output files.  


 \begin{itemize}
 	\item  \code{call\_dry.py} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \code{sim\_input} 
		\item \code{runmodel}
		\item \code{read\_sim}
	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 
 \code{call\_dry.py}  is a control script which writes the Fortan input files, compiles and executes the Fortran code dry.for, and reads the output files.
 

\code{sim\_input} makes the input files. 

\subsection{sim\_input}

 \code{sim\_input} specifies default parameters where no parameters are provided in \code{params.json}. For example, if \code{ncol} is not provided, an aspect ratio must be included instead (\code{aspect})


Notes on roughness parameters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item roughness parameters are specified separately for vegetated and bare cells. 
	\item parameters for the resistance formula for vegetated cells are specified as  \code{alpha}, \code{eta} and \code{m}  ($\alpha$, $\eta$ and $m$), and for bare soil cells as  \code{alpha\_B}, \code{eta\_B} and \code{m\_B}  ($\alpha_B$, $\eta_B$ and $m_B$).s
	\item The default soil parameters are Manning's equation with \code{alpha = 0.1}, and \code{alpha\_B = 0.03}.
\end{itemize}


Some variables cannot be initialized / specified from \code{params.json}  and must be modified within the code:
\begin{itemize}
\item inflow boundary dimensions (currently = entire upslope area)	
\item van Genuchten parameters of the seal layer
\item van Genuchten parameters are hard coded be the same between vegetated and bare cells (this can be changed in \code{input\_phi.py}). 
\end{itemize}


Note on the inflow boundary condition:  If the upslope boundary is a fixed flux boundary, \code{tr} also specifies that the time as which the inflow stops (i.e. the boundary changes from fixed flux to a wall boundary).  In the case of rain AND upslope inflow, for example, to simulate rain on a longer hillslope domain, the rain and inflow will end at the same time. The code would need to be modified with the addition of a new variable (e.g. time of inflow end) to change this, which would be straightforward.

%Either or inputs: \code{s\_scale} or \code{KsB}.  
%If \code{KsB} not in params.json, use \code{KsB = KsV/s\_scale}. 
%Default \code{s\_scale = 100.	}

%%%% Resistance formualtion 
	\item \code{scheme} : resistance formulation (default in Manning equation)
		\subitem specifying the scheme is equivalent to specifying eta and m (see source subroutine, where roughness formulation is implemented. Explicitly specifying m and/or eta will overwrite these default parameters. 
	\item \code{alpha} / $\alpha_V$ : generalized roughness parameters for vegetated / permeable areas. If Manning's equation is used to specify the resistance formulation, then  $\alpha_B = n_B$.
	\item \code{alpha\_B} / $\alpha_B$ : equivalent to \code{alpha} / $\alpha_V$   for bare soil areas.
%%%%%  Solver parameters 
	\item \code{epsh} / $\epsilon$: depth tolerance for dry cells.  The momentum equations are not solved if \code{h< epsh} ($h<\epsilon$).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Infiltration parameters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{KsV} : infiltration rate in vegetated/permeable areas, in cm/hr.  
		\subitem  Note \code{ksatV=KsV/3600.} is the infiltration rate in units of cm/s.
	\item \code{KsB} : infiltration rate in bare soil/impermeable areas, in cm/hr.  
		\subitem  Note \code{ksatB=KsB/3600.} is the infiltration rate in units of cm/s.
		\subitem If \code{KsB} is not specified, then \code{KsB} is set to \code{KsV/s\_scale}, where \code{s\_scale} is the ratio.
	\item \code{s\_scale} : the soil infiltration ratio between vegetated and non-vegetated (or permeable/impermeable) areas.

\section{Appendix A: \code{dry.f} parameters and variables }

\subsection{Source subroutine variables}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{isetflux} (common) specifies the boundary condition for the Richards equation solver.  \\[.2cm]
	 \code{isetflux} = 1 if the surface flux is specified: \code{flux = 0} in case 3 (no rain and no ponding), and \code{flux = prate} in case 2 (rain and no ponding).\\[.2cm]
	 \code{isetflux} = 0 if the surface H is specified (Dirichlet). If there is ponding (case 4), the surface boundary condition is $H$=$h$. 
	\item \code{flux} is the surface flux (cm/s).  \code{flux} is a common variable defined in \code{source}, and used by \code{timestep}  if \code{isetflux=1}. 

	\item \code{htop}: Upper boundary condition for fixed $H$ boundary condition (\code{isetflux=1}).

	\item \code{PI} Potential infiltration, computed by the \code{potential} subroutine.

\section{Introduction}

This model couples two pre-existing models: a 2D SVE solver [\textit{Bradford and Katopodes}, 1999] and a 1D Richards equation solver [\textit{Celia et al.}, 1990].	
The SVE solver uses a finite volume method involving two steps, predictor and corrector, to achieve second-order accuracy.  The SVE model is coupled at each grid cell and timestep to the Richards equation solver.
The core of the model is implemented in Fortran  (\code{dryR.for}), and Python  scripts are provided to write and read the Fortran files.
 
This document is divided into the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Section \ref{SVE}: A brief summary of the Saint Venant and Richards Equations.
	\item Section \ref{SVE_solver}:  An overview the SVE-R numerical methods, and how the two model components are coupled. 
%	\item  Infiltration and flow resistance are represented in the source term $Q$.
	\item Section \ref{}: An overview of the Python wrapper scripts,  which write the Fortran input files, compile and execute the Fortran code, and read and visualize the Fortran outputs. 
\end{itemize}		

\section{Background: equations and numerical methods }
\label{SVE}

\subsection{The 2D Saint Venant Equations (SVE)}
The SVE are written in integral form:

\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_\Omega \mathbf{U} d\Omega + \oint_\partial (\mathbf{F} dy - \mathbf{G} dx ) = \int_\Omega \mathbf{Q} d\Omega
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{U}^T = (h, hU, hV) $ is the vector of conservative variables. 


\[ \mathbf{F} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	h U  \\
	h U^2 + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \\
	h U V \\
\end{bmatrix}  ; \quad
\mathbf{G} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	h V \\
	h U V \\
	h V^2 + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \\	
\end{bmatrix}  
\]

where $h$ is the flow depth,  $z$ is the bed elevation, $U$ and $V$ are the vertically averaged velocities in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. 
The source terms are defined as:


 \[ \mathbf{Q} = 
%\begin{bmatrix}
%	 - i  \\[.1cm]
%	- g h \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} - c_D U \sqrt{U^2 + V^2} - \frac{ui}{2}\\[.1cm]
%	- g h \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} - c_D V \sqrt{U^2 + V^2} - \frac{vi}{2}\\[.1cm]
%\end{bmatrix}  = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
	p - i  \\[.1cm]
	- g h \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial x} - g h  S_{f,x} + \dfrac{u(p-i)}{2}\\[.1cm]
	- g h \dfrac{\partial z}{\partial y} - g h  S_{f,y} + \dfrac{v(p-i)}{2}\\[.1cm]
\end{bmatrix} 
\]

%where the first term shows the \textit{Bradford and Katopodes} (1999) source term, and the second term shows the modified version.
% $c_D$ is the bottom drag coefficient, and $c_D = g n^2 /h^{1/3}$ for Manning's equation. 
where $p$ is the rainfall rate,   $i$ is the infiltration rate of water into the bed, and $S_{f,x}$ and $S_{f,y}$ are the $x$ and $y$ components of the friction slope. 


\subsection{SVE numerical methods}

 The model is adapted from  \textit{Bradford and Katopodes} (1999), referred to here as BK, 
  and uses predictor-corrector time-stepping to provide a second-order accurate solution.
 The only significant difference between the BK model and the model described here is the coupling to a Richards equation solver.  The following summary of the numerical methods is adapted from \textit{Bradford and Katopodes} (1999), where a better and more complete explanation can be found. 
  
  A predictor is computed at  time level $n + 1/2$ by solving the primitive equations in generalized coordinates, and a corrector is computed at the $n + 1$ time level by solving the integral equations.  
   
 \subsubsection*{Predictor Step}

 The predictor solution is computed by solving the equations in primitive form. In generalized coordinates:

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial t} + 
	\mathbf{A}_W	\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial \xi} + 
	\mathbf{B}_W	\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{W}}{\partial \eta} =
	\mathbf{Q}_W
\label{predictor}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\xi$ and $\eta$ are in the directions of increasing $j$ and $k$ indices, respectively.
The  $j$,$k$ indices indicate the column and row numbers of a given cell, respectively (see Figure \ref{coords} schematic).
$\mathbf{W_T} = [h, U, V]$ is the array of primitive variables, and the matrices $\mathbf{A}_W$ and $\mathbf{B}_W$ are defined as:

\[ \mathbf{A}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\xi} & h \xi_x & h \xi_{y} \\
    g \xi_x &    U_{\xi}  & 0    \\
    g \xi_y &   0   & U_{\xi}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{B}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\eta} & h \eta_x    & h \eta_{y} \\
    g \eta_x &    U_{\eta}  & 0    \\
    g \eta_y &      0       & U_{\eta}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} 		
\]	


\noindent where $U_{\xi} = U \xi_x  + V \xi_y $ and $U_{\eta} = U \eta_x  + V \eta_y $.
$\xi_x$,  $\xi_y$,  $\eta_x$ and  $\eta_y$ are the grid transformation metrics for mapping $x$ and $y$ to $\xi$ and  $\eta$. In Cartesian coordinates, the generalized coordinates simplify to: $\xi  = x$ and  $\eta  = y$.

The predictor solution in cell $j$, $k$ at $t + \Delta t/2$  is given as:

 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{W}_{j,k}^{n+1/2} = \mathbf{W}_{j,k}^{n}
- \frac{\Delta t}{2} (
	\mathbf{A}_W \overline{\Delta \mathbf{W}}_\xi+
	\mathbf{B}_W \overline{\Delta \mathbf{W}}_\eta-
	\mathbf{Q}_W)_{j,k}^{n+1/2}
\label{predictor}
\end{equation}


\noindent where the overbar denotes a cell-average gradient of $\mathbf{W}$ in cell $j$, $k$,  which is computed with a flux limiter (nonlinear average) in order to preserve solution monotonicity.  Flux limiters  become first-order accurate near discontinuities while remaining second-order accurate elsewhere, and several options are included in the code, described in Section \ref{SVE_solver}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=15pc]{grid/coords.png}
 \caption{Sketch of a computational cell, after BK Figure 2.}
 \label{coords}
 \end{figure}
  

 \subsubsection*{Corrector Step}
 
 The corrector solution is obtained from the conservative form of the governing equations.
 
 The predictor solutions are reconstructed to the left and right of each cell face using the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL), which achieves second-order spatial accuracy.  The reconstructed predictor values define a Reimann problem at each cell face, which are used to compute the interfacial fluxes:
 
\begin{equation} \nonumber
	\dfrac{\mathbf{U}_{j,k}^{n+1} -\mathbf{U}_{j,k}^{n}}{\Delta t} 
	+ \dfrac{1}{\Omega_{j,k}} \big[ 
		- \mathbf{F}_{\perp 1}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_1
		+ \mathbf{F}_{\perp 2}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_2
		+ \mathbf{F}_{\perp 3}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_3
		- \mathbf{F}_{\perp 4}^{n+1/2} \Delta s_4		
	\big] = \mathbf{Q}^{n+1/2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ are the cell-center values in cell $j,k$ with area $\Omega$, $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{G}$ are the average boundary values on each cell face, and $\delta s$ is the length of the cell faces.
The indices 1 through 4 denote the four cell faces: index 1 corresponds to the bottom cell face, and the remaining cell faces are numbered in counter-clockwise order.

The flux $\mathbf{F}$  is normal to the cell boundary and positive in the direction of increasing cell coordinates.  $\mathbf{F}$  is defined as:

\[ \mathbf{F}_\perp = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    h u_\perp \\[0.1cm]
    h u u_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \cos \phi   \\[0.1cm]
    h v u_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \sin \phi   \\[0.1cm]    
\end{bmatrix}  		
\]	

where $u_\perp$ is the velocity perpendicular to the cell face, and $\phi$ is the angle between the face normal vector and the $x$-axis.

The fluxes are evaluated using a Godunov-type upwind scheme in which a Riemann problem is solved across each cell face, using the method of Roe (1981).  Further details can be found in BK. 
%The scheme is summarized with the equation:
%
%\begin{equation} 
%\mathbf{F}_{\perp I} = \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{F}_{\perp L} + \mathbf{F}_{\perp R }- \mathbf{\hat{R}} |\mathbf{\hat{\Lambda}} |\mathbf{\Delta \hat{V}}  )
%\label{riemann}
%\end{equation}
%where the subscript $I$ denotes the interface between two adjacent cells, and the subscripts $L$ and $R$ refer to the left and right sides of the interface.  $\Delta$ is the finite difference across the cell interface. 

% Predicted values to the left and right of each face in a cell are first reconstructed, i.e. at the right cell face:
% \begin{equation}
% \mathbf{W}_{j+1/2,k}^{n+1/2L}  = \mathbf{W}_{j,k}^{n+1/2L} + \frac{1}{2} \overline{\Delta W_\xi}|_{j,k}^n
%  \end{equation}

% The fluxes are computed with Roeâ€™s approximate Riemann solver and the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws.
% 
%
%The flux $\mathbf{F}_\perp$ is positive in the direction of increasing computational coordinates, normal to the cell boundary, and described as: 
%
%\[ \mathbf{F}_\perp = 
%\begin{bmatrix}
%	 \code{h $U_\perp$} \\
%	 \code{h U U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \cos \phi} \\
%	 \code{h V U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \sin \phi} \\
%\end{bmatrix} 
% =  {
%	 \begin{bmatrix}
%	 \code{h U_\perp} \\
%	 \code{h U U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \cos \phi} \\
%	 \code{h V U_\perp + \frac{1}{2} g h^2 \sin \phi} \\
%\end{bmatrix} 
%}  \]
%
%where $U_\perp$ (\code{uperp}) is the velocity perpendicular to the cell face, and 


\subsubsection*{The source term }

The source term $\mathbf{Q}$ contains the parameterization of the surface roughness (via the friction slope $S_f$  and the lateral inputs (rainfall $p$ and infiltration $i$).  Infiltration is independently modeled at each timestep and grid cell with the 1D Richards equation, described in the next subsection.
  
 The friction slope is specified in the generalized form: 

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_{f,x} = \bigg( \dfrac{\alpha  U}{h^m}\bigg)^{1/\eta} \dfrac{|U|}{U}; \quad
S_{f,y} = \bigg( \dfrac{\alpha  V}{h^m}\bigg)^{1/\eta} \dfrac{|U|}{V}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $\alpha$ is a  roughness parameter, and $m$ specifies the flow regime ($m=2$ for laminar flow, 1/2 for turbulent flow).   $\eta$=1/2 for most roughness schemes, with the exception of laminar flow, for which $\eta$=1.  For Manning's equation, $\alpha = n$, $m=2/3$ and $\eta=1/2$:

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_{f,x} =  \dfrac{n^2 U}{h^{4/3}} |U|; \quad
S_{f,y} = \dfrac{n^2 V}{h^{4/3}} |U|
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent More generally, with $\eta=1/2$:
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_{f,x} = \dfrac{\alpha^2 }{h^m}  U |U|; \quad
S_{f,y} = \dfrac{\alpha^2 }{h^m} V |U|
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Richards equation}

Richards equation is solved following the approach outlined by \textit{Celia et al.} (1990), which involves a backward Euler approximation in time coupled with a simple Picard iteration scheme.  
The solver used the discrete approximation of the  mixed $H$-$\theta$ form: 

\begin{equation} 
	\dfrac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot K \nabla H - \dfrac{\partial K}{\partial z} = 0
\label{richards}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $z$ denotes the vertical dimension (assumed positive upwards),  $\theta$ is the soil moisture content, $H$ is the matric potential and $K$ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.
 $\theta$ and matric potential $H$ are related via the Van Genuchten water retention curve. The volumetric soil moisture content, $\theta$, and effective saturation, $S_e$, are computed as:

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
\theta = \dfrac{\theta_S â€“ \theta_R}{1 + (\alpha|H|)^n)^m} + \theta_R
\label{vanG_eqn}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
S_e = \dfrac{\theta â€“ \theta_R}{\theta_S â€“ \theta_R}
\label{Se}
\end{eqnarray}

 where $\theta_S$ and  $\theta_R$ are the saturated and residual soil moisture content; $n$ is a measure of the pore size distribution; $m=(1-1/n)$; and $\alpha$  is related to the inverse of the air entry suction.  The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity $K(\theta)$ is computed as:

\begin{eqnarray}
K = K_s \sqrt{S_e} [1 â€“ (1 â€“ S_e^{1/m})^m]^2
\label{K}
\end{eqnarray}

where $K_s$ is the saturated hydraulic conductivity.
The infiltration rate is solved with Darcy's law:

\begin{equation}
q =-  K \bigg(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial z} + 1\bigg)
\label{darcy}
\end{equation}

where the 1  (second term) on the RHS of Equation \ref{darcy} reflects the fact that $H$ is the matric head, as opposed to the hydraulic head.

%Equation \ref{richards} is approximated as:
%\begin{equation} 
%	\dfrac{\theta^{n+1,m+1} - \theta^{n}} {\Delta t}  - \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \bigg( K^{n+1, m} 	\dfrac{\partial H^{n+1,m+1}} {\partial z}  \bigg) - 	\dfrac{\partial K^{n+1,m}} {\partial z}  = 0
%\label{celia14}
%\end{equation}
%
% where $n$ represents the time level and $m$ represents the iteration level  (note: the conflicting $n$ and $m$ in equation \ref{celia14} follow \textit{Celia et al.} (1990)).
% 

\subsubsection*{Coupling the SVE and Richards Equation models}

The model components are coupled at each grid cell in two steps: the depth from the SVE solver provides the surface boundary condition to the Richards equation solver, and the infiltration rate from the Richards equation solver is used by the SVE source term. This requires that several cases be accounted for: (1) no rain and no ponding, (2) rain but no ponding, and (3)  ponding (with or without rain).   In case (1), a no flux boundary condition is applied at the surface.
 In case (2), the Richards equation solver computes a potential infiltration rate ($PI$), defined as the infiltration rate that would occur with $H=0
 $ cm at the surface, and compares this value to the rainfall intensity, $p$.  If $p$ exceeds the potential infiltration rate, ponding begins and the  boundary condition switches to case (3).  Otherwise, the potential infiltration rate is greater than $p$, and $i=p$. Finally, in case (3), the upper boundary condition $H$ is equal to the ponding depth $h$.  These cases are schematically illustrated in Figure \ref{richardgrid}.
 
 	
 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{grid/richards.png}
 \caption{Schematic to illustrate the boundary condition cases for Richards equation. $PI$ is the potential infiltration rate, which is computed to determine whether the rain intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil (in which case ponding occurs).}

\section{SVE-R Fortran code}

This section outlines the structure of the Fortran code, how to compile and execute it, and the required input files.  Further details on the the SVE and Richards equation solvers, particularly those relating the mathematical equations in Section 2 to the code in the Fortran subroutines, can be found in Appendix A.

\label{SVE_solver}


\subsection{SVE-R model structure}

\code{dry.f} can be compiled and executed from an Mac Os terminal with:

\hspace*{8mm} \code{gFortran -o ./sw  -framework accelerate ./dry.for} \\
\hspace*{8mm} \code{.sw} \\

 where \code{.sw} is the name of the executable.  \code{dry.f} interacts with a number of auxiliary files (see screenshot in Figure \ref{files}), including:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{\code{dry.inc}}: specifies common variables used by \code{dry.f}  (a number of variables are ``common" variables, and not explicitly returned by the Fortran subroutines). 
	\item \code{input}:  files to initialize \code{dry.f} are located in this folder.
	\item \code{output}: \code{dry.f} saves the outputs to this folder.	
	\item \code{params.json}: user-supplied parameter dictionary
	\item \code{.sw}: the compiled Fortran executable.
	\item \code{.ipynb} files: Jupyter notebooks to visualize the simulation outputs.

 \caption{Auxiliary files associated with \code{dry.f}.}
 \label{files}
 \end{figure}


Figure \ref{summary} summarizes the organization of \code{dry.f}, which can be divided into main two steps: (1) initializing and (2) executing a time loop.   The following subsections describe the model components in greater detail.

 \caption{Summary of the SVE-R model structure in \code{dry.f}.}
 \label{summary}
 \end{figure}


\subsection{Model set-up}
\label{SVEinit}
	
The \code{init} subroutine initializes the SVE component of the model,  which involves reading a number of scalar parameters from  \code{params.dat} and setting up the simulation grid.
 The infiltration parameters are initialized by the subroutine \code{initVG}.  The following briefly describes the input files, and further details are included in Appendix B (including an illustrative example of a  2$\times$2 grid).
  
\subsubsection*{Input files}

The following is a brief list of required input files (see Appendix B for further details and examples).

\begin{itemize}

	\item \code{params.dat}:  specifies a number of scalar parameters (read by the \code{init} subroutine).  

	\item \code{coords.dat}: contains the $x$,$y$,$z$ coordinates at the cell nodes.

	\item \code{boundary.dat}: describes the boundary types and locations.

	\item \code{veg.dat}: contains the vegetation pattern.

	\item \code{nodes.dat}: contains a list of the node numbers surrounding each grid cell.

	\item \code{vanG.dat} : Van Genuchten parameters and initial $H$ as a function of depth for vegetated and bare soil cells. 

\end{itemize}



\subsubsection*{Grid variables}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{nn} : space allocated to the grid (\code{nn>np}).
	\item  \code{np}:  the number of cell nodes. 
	\item \code{x(nn), y(nn), zz(nn)} : $x,y,z$ coordinates of the cell nodes.  \\[0.1cm]
		\code{x,y,zz} are read as 1D arrays, and interpolated to a 2D grid with the help of the nodes file \code{nodes.dat}.
		\item  \code{xc, yc, zc} : coordinates at the cell centers, with dimensions \code{(ncol, nrow)}

	\item \code{nop(nx,ny,4)}: node numbers defining each grid cell (see Figure \ref{nodes}).  

	\item \code{inum}: number of boundary interfaces of each cell.
	\item \code{itype}:  interface type of each cell boundary (1 for wall boundaries, 0 for open boundaries...).  
	\item \code{ipos}: position of each cell boundary (1 for lower boundaries, 2 for right boundaries...).
\end{itemize}

 \caption{Schematic of the nodes and boundary naming convention. }
 \label{nodes}
 \end{figure}
 



\subsection{Model output}

 \code{dry.f} saves the following  files in the \code{output} subfolder.
Most variables are saved at intervals of  $dt\_p$, to limit the size of the output files, with the exception of the hydrograph, which is saved at 1 s resolution.   
\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{dvol.out}:  output file to check mass balance. Read by function \code{get\_dvol} in \code{output\_dry.py}.
	\item \code{fluxes1234.out}: lateral boundary fluxes, grouped by boundary  position (i.e. boundary positions 1-4).  
	\item \code{h.out}: primitive variables $h$,$U$, $V$, infiltration $I$ and interfacial fluxes (spatially-distributed fields, saved at every grid-cell)
	\item \code{summary.out} : summarizes ponding time, runtime, final time, and if applicable, the reason for an early exit (i.e. no more water, AMAX too big) 
	\item \code{hydro.out}: hydrograph at 1 second time resolution (m$^3$/s).  
	\item \code{ptsTheta.out} : soil moisture profiles at two points, one vegetated and one bare. 
	\item \code{time.out}: file containing time, and max CFL number at each timestep.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Principal model components (\code{dry.f} subroutines)}

This section provides a high level summary of the main model components (i.e. \code{dry.f} subroutines) and how they connect.  Further information and details can be found in Appendix A.

\subsubsection*{The predictor step}

The \code{predict} subroutine is called to compute \code{hp}, \code{up},  \code{vp},corresponding to $h^{n+1/2}$,$u^{n+1/2}$,$v^{n+1/2}$, at each cell.   It modifies the common variables  \code{hp}, \code{up},  \code{vp}, \code{dh}, \code{du}, \code{dv}, \code{qs}.

\subsubsection*{Corrector step}

The corrector step computes the fluxes between the cell interfaces by calling the \code{fluxes} subroutine for each cell and for each interface. 

The interfacial cell fluxes at a given time-step are stored in the common variable \code{f(0:nx,0:ny,1:3,1:2)}, where the first two indices of \code{f} contain the $j,k$ coordinates, the third index correspond to the components of  $\mathbf{F_\perp}$ (see Equation), and the final index denotes the cell face (1 for vertical cell faces and 2 for horizontal).   
\code{f(j,k,1:3,1)} represents the flux from cell $(j-1, k)$ to $(j, k)$, and
\code{f(j,k,1:3,2)} represents the flux from cell $(j, k-1)$ to $(j, k)$ (see Figure \ref{fluxes_specific}).
Calling \code{fluxes(j-1,j,k,k,1)} modifies \code{f(j,k,1:3,1)}  and calling \code{fluxes(j,j,k-1,k,2)} \code{f(j,k,1:3,2)}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=15pc]{grid/fluxes_specific.png}
 \caption{Definitional sketch for the interfacial fluxes, indicating how the fluxes into and out of cell (j,k) are stored in the array \code{f(0:nx,0:ny,1:3,1:2)}}.
 \label{fluxes_specific.png}
 \end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Fluxes subroutine}

Within the \code{fluxes} subroutine, \code{fluxes(jl,jr,kl,kr,i1)} computes the flux from cell \code{(jl,kl)} to \code{(jr,kr)}, modifying the common variable \code{f(jr,kr,1:3,i1)}. 
\code{i1 = 1} indicates that the flux is between vertical cell faces, i.e. from cell \code{(j-1,k)} to \code{(j,k)}.
Similarly, \code{i1 = 2} indicates that the flux is between horizontal cell faces, i.e. from cell \code{(j,k-1)} to \code{(j,k)}.

 
\code{fluxes}  first reconstructs the predicted values to the left and right of each face (\code{hl,hr,ul, ur,vl,vr)} using the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL).  These reconstructed predictor values define a Riemann problem at each cell face, and \code{fluxes} calls the \code{solver} subroutine to compute $\mathbf{F_{\perp I}}$ from Equation \ref{riemann}, reproduced below:

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{F_{\perp I}} =
	 \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{F_{\perp L}} + \mathbf{F_{\perp R}} - \mathbf{\hat{R} |\hat{\Lambda}| \Delta \hat V  })
\end{equation*}

%% equations from BK are reproduced here in order to relate these equations to  the Fortran code.t

\subsubsection*{The \code{source} subroutine}

% Infiltration and surface resistance are represented in 
 The source term is computed with the subroutine \code{source}, which modifies the common variable \code{qs} (or $Q(j,k)$).
  \code{source} is called by both the predictor and corrector steps; however, Richards equation is only solved during corrector step. 
 The input arguments are the  cell indices \code{j,k}, the primitive variables, and an indicator variable \code{lstep} for the step type (\code{lstep = 0} for the predictor step and 1 for the corrector step.		
 
In the predictor step, \code{source} is called for each cell before updating the predictor values (\code{hp,up,vp}).  \code{source} is similarly  called in the corrector step before updating the fluxes.

\subsubsection*{Infiltration details (corrector-step)}

In the corrector step, \code{source} calls the infiltration-specific subroutines (\code{timestep} and \code{potential} to update the infiltration rate $i$ and the surface boundary conditions at cell \code{j,k}. 
%calls th subroutines (\code{potential} and \code{timestep}) to solve Richards equation. 
\code{timestep} solves Richards equation at cell \code{(j,k)} and returns the updated $H$, $\theta$ and $K$, which \code{source} uses to compute the infiltration rate $i$. \code{potential} is used to prescribe the boundary conditions. 

 The Richards equation solver is implemented separately for each grid cell, and the 3-dimensional $H$, $\theta$ and $K$  fields are saved as the common variables \code{r8H} (cm), \code{r8Theta}, and  \code{r8K} (cm/s), respectively, with dimensions (\code{nrow} $\times$ \code{ncol} $\times$ \code{nz}).\\ 

The \code{potential} subroutine computes the infiltration that would occur with $H=0$ at the surface ($PI$/\code{PI}), and is required for Richards case 2 in Figure \ref{richards}.

\noindent From Darcy's law, the infiltration rate $i$ (cm/s) is computed as:
$$ i =  K \bigg(\frac{\partial H}{\partial z} + 1\bigg ) $$
which corresponds to \code{r8kt*((hdum(nz)-hdum(nz-1))/dz+1)} in \code{source}.

\noindent  As an intermediate step, the depth is updated with: \\
\begin{center}
\code{znew=  zold + prate*100*dt - r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)*dt } 	
\end{center}
where \code{prate}  rainfall has been converted to cm/s.
 \code{winflt} = $p-i$  is then computed as:
\begin{center}
 \code{winflt = (znew - zold)/dt/100.} 	
\end{center}

%Note that \code{znew} is computed as a separate step for code readability, and things could be simplified to: \code{winflt = prate*100 - r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)} .
	
 

Richards equation is solved by the \code{timestep} subroutine, which is called from \code{source}.
 Richards equation is solved every \code{iscale} timesteps. 
  For all other SVE time steps, the infiltration rate is estimated as:
		  \begin{center}
			\code{r8kt*((hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1.d0)*dt} 		  	
		  \end{center}
		if the depth is greater than zero.    Ponding does not occur until the \code{potential} subroutine determines that the rainfall exceeds to potential infiltration rate ($p>PI$). 		
		
When there is rain but no ponding (\code{depth=0} and \code{prate > 0}), the  \code{potential} subroutine is called to estimate a potential infiltration rate $PI$, defined as the infiltration that would occur with $H=0$ at the surface (in cm/s). \\  
If the potential infiltration rate is less than the rainfall rate (\code{(PI .lt. prate*100)}), ponding begins.  In this case, the Richards boundary condition is switched to fixed $H$.


	
\section{The Simulated Domain}
\label{domain}
To simulate runoff/runon environments on patchily-vegetated hillslopes, several aspects of the BK model have been modified (in addition to coupling to a 1D Richards solver).  This section describes the simulated domain, as illustrated in Figure \ref{domain_schematic}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{grid/domain_schematic.png}
 \caption{Schematic of the model domain.  The darker shading under the non-vegetated regions represents the surface crust.  $K_{s,V}$ and $K_{s,B}$  represent the saturated hydraulic conductivities of undisturbed soil and surface crust, respectively.}
 \label{domain_schematic}
 \end{figure}
 
 
First,  roughness parameters are specified separately for vegetated and bare cells. 
 The parameters for the resistance formula for vegetated cells are specified as  \code{alpha}, \code{eta} and \code{m}  ($\alpha$, $\eta$ and $m$), and for bare soil cells as  \code{alpha\_B}, \code{eta\_B} and \code{m\_B}  ($\alpha_B$, $\eta_B$ and $m_B$).
  The default soil parameters are Manning's equation with \code{alpha = 0.1}, and \code{alpha\_B = 0.03}.


The model is set up to specify rain-driven overland flow on a planar hillslope, for which the lateral boundaries are closed with the exception of the open boundary at the bottom of the hillslope.  Limited support is provided for a fixed flux (subcritical) upslope boundary condition,  where the inflow boundary dimensions are equal to the entire upslope area.  Code for other boundary conditions is not provided, but can be implemented with modification to \code{input\_coords.py} (or directly to the Fortran input parameter functions).
For a fixed flux upslope boundary, \code{tr} also specifies that the time as which the inflow stops (i.e. the boundary changes from fixed flux to a wall boundary).  In the case of rain AND upslope inflow, for example, to simulate rain on a longer hillslope domain, the rain and inflow will end at the same time. The code would need to be modified with the addition of a new variable (e.g. time of inflow end) to change this, which would be straightforward. 

The bare soil areas are represented by a two-layer model, where the upper, less-permeable  layer represents a surface crust.  With the exception of $K_{s}$, the van Genuchten parameters are the same between vegetated and bare cells. In the bare soil areas, $K_{s}$ of the lower soil layer is  equal to that in the vegetated patches (See schematic).
The van Genuchten parameters and vertical structure of the soil can be modified in \code{input\_phi.py}.


\section{Python wrapper scripts}



\begin{itemize}
\item \code{write\_nodes(path, ncol, nrow)  }: writes the cell node indices to \code{input/nodes.dat}.  
    This function assumes that the grid is rectangular, and would need to be modified for a non-rectangular grid. 
       It saves \code{nop}, which contains the indices of the nodes surrounding each cell face.
\item \code{build\_coords(params)} : constructs the \code{x,y,z} coordinates fields. 
\end{itemize}

%\noindent Note: \code{coords.pklz} stores the cell center coordinates in a Python readable file, and is not a Fortran input file.


Example Python scripts are provided to generate the Fortran input files, execute \code{dry.f} and read the outputs.   \code{call\_dry.py} is a control script which executes each of these components, as illustrated in the Figure \ref{schematic} schematic.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=38pc]{grid/schematic.png}
 \caption{Schematic illustrating the python wrapper script workflow. \code{call\_dry} takes as input \code{sim\_name}, the name of a subfolder containing the parameter file \code{params.json}.}
 \label{schematic}
 \end{figure}
 
 
\code{output\_dry.py} contains three main sub-functions, listed below:
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item  \code{call\_dry.py} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \code{sim\_input.py} 
		\item \code{runmodel}
		\item \code{sim\_read.py}
	\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
 
 \code{call\_dry.py}  is a control script which writes the Fortan input files, compiles and executes the Fortran code dry.for, and reads the output files.

 
\subsection{\code{sim\_input.py}: writes the Fortran input files}


\code{sim\_input.py} takes the input arguement \code{sim\_path}, the path to the simulation directory containing a parameter file \code{params.json}, and sets up the file structure required by \code{dry.f}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item copies \code{dry.f} and \code{dry.inc} to \code{sim\_path}
	\item makes \code{sim\_path/input} and \code{sim\_path/output} subdirectories
	\item  reads and interprets the parameter file \code{params.json}    
\end{itemize}   


\code{sim\_input.py} calls the following functions to write the input files (located in \code{sim\_name/input}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{write\_param}: writes the general parameter file  \code{params.dat}.
	\item \code{input\_veg.py}: contains functions to write the input vegetation file \code{veg.dat}.
	\item \code{input\_coords.py}: contains functions to write the  grid and topography files \code{coords.dat}, \code{nodes.dat}. 
	\item \code{input\_boundary.py} contains functions to write the boundary file \code{boundary.dat}.
\end{itemize}

See appendix B for examples of the Fortran input files.

	\item \code{tr} : storm duration (min)
	\item \code{p} : rain intensity (cm/hr)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{\code{runmodel}: compiles and execute \code{dry.f}}
The function \code{runmodel}, located in \code{call\_dry.py}, uses the Python os library to compile and execute \code{dry.f} with command line arguments: 

\begin{verbatim}
 os.system("gfortran -o {0}/sw  -framework accelerate {0}/dry.for".format(sim_path))
 os.system("cd {0} \n ./sw  \n cd {1}".format(sim_path, current_dir))	
\end{verbatim}

    
\subsection{\code{read\_sim}: reads the Fortran output files }

The output files are read by \code{sim\_read.py}, which reads the output files and saves the results as a dictionary  \code{sim.pklz}.  The variables to be saved are provided in the list \code{fortran\_outvars}.

which calls the following functions to read the output files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{read\_time}: reads \code{time.out}
	\item \code{read\_hydro} : reads \code{hydro.out} and returns \code{t\_h} and \code{hydro}. The hydrograph is normalized by the hillslope dimensions to convert m$^3$/s to cm/s.
	\item \code{get\_h} : reads \code{h.out}, which contains the primitive variables (\code{h,u,v}), infiltration  (\code{inflVmap}), and the inter-cell fluxes \code{xflux0,yflux0,xflux1,yflux1}, all with dimensions: \code{nprt x ncol x nrow} (where \code{nprt} is the number of timesteps).
	\item \code{get\_dvol.py}: reads \code{dvol.out}, containing volume tracking variables  \code{vol},  \code{flux} and  \code{infl}, representing the total change in volume, lateral boundary fluxes and infiltration since the previous print timestep (i.e. \code{dt\_p}). \code{get\_dvol.py} normalizes by the domain area and converts to cm. 
\end{itemize}

The following is a partial list of grid correspondences:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $ U_\xi = \code{uxi} $
	\item $ U_\eta = \code{ueta}$
	\item  $d\xi$ = \code{dxi}

% Vertical cell faces have index 1, horizontal faces have index 2
% \code{ds(j,k,2)} : area of the lower horizontal boundary of cell \code{j,k} (\code{ipos = 1}), in m$^2$.

\subsection{The predictor step}

The \code{predict} subroutine is called for each cell to obtain \code{hp}, \code{up},  \code{vp} (corresponding to $h^{n+1/2}$,$u^{n+1/2}$,$v^{n+1/2}$).   \code{predict}  modifies the common variables  \code{hp}, \code{up},  \code{vp}, \code{dh}, \code{du}, \code{dv}, \code{qs}.


The following provides an (incomplete) correspondence between BK equations and Fortran code, with the mathematical notation in \textit{italics} and the equivalent code in \code{typewriter}.   For example, for the array of primitive variables:
\[  \mathbf{W_T} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	h \\
	U \\
	V \\
\end{bmatrix}
 =  {
	 \begin{bmatrix}
	 \code{h} \\
	 \code{u} \\	 
	 \code{v} \\	 	 	 
\end{bmatrix} 
}  \]


The matrices $\mathbf{A}_W$ and $\mathbf{B}_W$ are defined as: 

\[ \mathbf{A}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\xi} & h \xi_x & h \xi_{y} \\
    g \xi_x &    U_{\xi}  & 0    \\
    g \xi_y &   0   & U_{\xi}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \code{ uxi }& \code{h} \ \code{dxi(1)} &\code{h*dxi(2)}\\
    \code{g dxi(1)}& \code{uxi} & 0  \\    
    \code{g dxi(2)}&     0       & \code{uxi}  \\          
\end{bmatrix} 
\]

\[ \mathbf{B}_w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\eta} & h \eta_x    & h \eta_{y} \\
    g \eta_x &    U_{\eta}  & 0    \\
    g \eta_y &      0       & U_{\eta}    \\    
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
    \code{ ueta }  & \code{h*deta(1) } & \code{ h*deta(2)}\\
    \code{g dxi(1)} & \code{ueta}  & 0  \\    
    \code{g dxi(2)} &     0  	   &  \code{ueta}  \\          
\end{bmatrix} 
\]


\[ \partial_\xi \mathbf{W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \partial_\xi h \\
	\partial_\xi u \\
    \partial_\xi v \\
\end{bmatrix}
 =  {
	 \begin{bmatrix}
	 \code{dh(1)} \\
	 \code{du(1)} \\	 
	 \code{dv(1)} \\	 	 	 
\end{bmatrix} 
}  ;  \quad  \quad
\partial_\eta \mathbf{W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \partial_\eta h \\
	\partial_\eta u \\
    \partial_\eta v \\
\end{bmatrix}
 =  {
	 \begin{bmatrix}
	 \code{dh(2)} \\
	 \code{du(2)} \\	 
	 \code{dv(2)} \\	 	 	 
\end{bmatrix} 
}
 \] 


where  \code{dh(1)} implies \code{dh(j,k,1)}, and similarly for  \code{du(1)} and  \code{dv(1)}. 

$ \mathbf{A}_w \partial_\xi \mathbf{W} $ is computed as:

\[ \mathbf{A}_w \partial_\xi \mathbf{W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    U_{\xi} & h \xi_x & h \xi_{y}  \\
    g \xi_x &    U_{\xi}  & 0   \\
    g \xi_y &   0   & U_{\xi}    \\           
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \partial_\xi h \\
	\partial_\xi u \\
    \partial_\xi v \\
\end{bmatrix}
 =  
	 \begin{bmatrix}
	  U_{\xi}  \partial_\xi h +  h \xi_x  \partial_\xi u + h \xi_{y} \partial_\xi v \\[.1cm]
	  g \xi_x \partial_\xi h  +  U_{\xi} \partial_\xi u    \\[.1cm]
	  g \xi_y  \partial_\xi h  +  U_{\xi}  \partial_\xi v  \\	 	 
\end{bmatrix} 
 \]

Equivalently in code:

\begin{equation*}\label{theta-alt}
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}_w \partial_\xi \mathbf{W}  &=
 \begin{bmatrix}
     \code{uxi} & \code{h dxi(1)} & \code{h  dxi(2) } \\
     \code{g dxi(1)} & \code{uxi} &  0  \\     
     \code{g dxi(2)} & 0 &  \code{uxi}  \\     
\end{bmatrix}
	 \begin{bmatrix}
	 \code{dh(1)} \\
	 \code{du(1)} \\	 
	 \code{dv(1)} \\	 	  	 	 
\end{bmatrix}  = \\
&\qquad\qquad
	 \begin{bmatrix}
	  \code{uxi*dh(1) + h*(dxi(1)*du(1) + dxi(2)*dv(1))} \\
	   \code{g*dxi(1)*dh(1)  + uxi*du(1) } \\ 	 	 	 	 
	   \code{g*dxi(2)*dh(1)  + uxi*du(1) } \\ 	 	 	 	 	   
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}



The \code{limitr} subroutine contains the flux limiter that the predictor step uses to compute the cell-average spatial gradients (which preserves solution monotonicity by becoming first-order accurate near discontinuities, yet remains second-order accurate elsewhere).
Various choices are included, with the parameter \code{ilim} specifying the averaging type. \code{ilim}=5 instructs the code to use the $\beta$ family of averages, and is given by:

\begin{eqnarray*}
	\mathbf{\overline{\Delta W}} = \text{sign}(a)\text{min}[\text{max}(|a|, |b|), \beta(|a|, |b|)]  \textmd{ if }  ab>0  \\ 
	0 \textmd{ if }  ab \leq 0	
\end{eqnarray*}

$\beta$ = 1 yields the relatively more dissipative Minmod average, and $\beta $ = 2 yields the less dissipative Superbee average. 


\subsection{The corrector step}

The corrector step computes the fluxes between the cell interfaces by calling the \code{fluxes} subroutine for each cell \code{j,k} and for each interface. 

The interfacial cell fluxes at a given time-step are stored in the common variable \code{f(0:nx,0:ny,1:3,1:2)}, where the first two indices of \code{f} contain the $j,k$ coordinates, the third index correspond to the components of  $\mathbf{F_\perp}$ (see Equation), and the final index denotes the cell face (1 for vertical cell faces and 2 for horizontal).   
\code{f(j,k,1:3,1)} represents the flux from cell $(j-1, k)$ to $(j, k)$, and
\code{f(j,k,1:3,2)} represents the flux from cell $(j, k-1)$ to $(j, k)$ (see Figure \ref{fluxes_specific}).
Calling \code{fluxes(j-1,j,k,k,1)} modifies \code{f(j,k,1:3,1)}  and calling \code{fluxes(j,j,k-1,k,2)} \code{f(j,k,1:3,2)}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
 \centering
\includegraphics[width=15pc]{grid/fluxes_specific.png}
 \caption{Definitional sketch for the interfacial fluxes, indicating how the fluxes into and out of cell (j,k) are stored in the array \code{f(0:nx,0:ny,1:3,1:2)}}.
 \label{fluxes_specific.png}
 \end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Fluxes subroutine}

Within the \code{fluxes} subroutine, \code{fluxes(jl,jr,kl,kr,i1)} computes the flux from cell \code{(jl,kl)} to \code{(jr,kr)}, modifying the common variable \code{f(jr,kr,1:3,i1)}. 
\code{i1 = 1} indicates that the flux is between vertical cell faces, i.e. from cell \code{(j-1,k)} to \code{(j,k)}.
Similarly, \code{i1 = 2} indicates that the flux is between horizontal cell faces, i.e. from cell \code{(j,k-1)} to \code{(j,k)}.

 
\code{fluxes}  first reconstructs the predicted values to the left and right of each face (\code{hl,hr,ul, ur,vl,vr)} using the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL).  These reconstructed predictor values define a Riemann problem at each cell face, and \code{fluxes} calls the \code{solver} subroutine to compute $\mathbf{F_{\perp I}}$ from Equation \ref{riemann}, reproduced below:

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{F_{\perp I}} =
	 \frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{F_{\perp L}} + \mathbf{F_{\perp R}} - \mathbf{\hat{R} |\hat{\Lambda}| \Delta \hat V  })
\end{equation*}

%% equations from BK are reproduced here in order to relate these equations to  the Fortran code.t

\subsubsection*{The solver subroutine}

This subroutine uses the monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws (MUSCL) to compute $\mathbf{F_\perp}$ at each cell face.  The code in \code{solver} corresponds to the Equation \ref{riemann} as: 

 \begin{itemize}
 	\item $\mathbf{\hat{R}}$ : \code{e(3,3)}
 	\item $\mathbf{|\hat{\Lambda}|}$ : \code{a(3) }x
 	\item $\mathbf{ \Delta \hat V  }  $ : \code{ws(3)} 
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{The source subroutine}

% Infiltration and surface resistance are represented in 
 The source term is computed with the subroutine \code{source}, which modifies the common variable \code{qs} (or $Q(j,k)$).
  \code{source} is called by both the predictor and corrector steps; however, Richards equation is only solved during corrector step. 
 The input arguments are the  cell indices \code{j,k}, the primitive variables, and an indicator variable \code{lstep} for the step type (\code{lstep = 0} for the predictor step and 1 for the corrector step.		
 
In the predictor step, \code{source} is called for each cell before updating the predictor values (\code{hp,up,vp}):
\begin{center}
\code{call source(j, k, h(j,k), u(j,k), v(j,k), 0)}
\end{center}

 
\code{source} is similarly  called in the corrector step before updating the fluxes: 
\begin{center}
\code{call source(j, k, hp(j,k), up(j,k), v[(j,k), 0)}
\end{center}

Inside \code{source}, the primitive variables are labeled \code{depth,udum,vdum}. 
The source term in Fortran code is given as:

\[ \mathbf{Q} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
	\code{winflt}  \\[.1cm]
	\code{-grav*depth*sx(j,k)-grav*depth*fricSx+0.5*udum*winflt}\\[.1cm]
	\code{-grav*depth*sy(j,k)-grav*depth*fricSy+0.5*vdum*winflt}\\[.1cm]
\end{bmatrix} 
\]

where $S_{f,x}$ = \code{fricSx} and  $S_{f,x}$ = \code{fricSy}, and $p-i$ = \code{winflt}.


\subsubsection*{Infiltration details (corrector-step)}

In the corrector step, \code{source} calls the infiltration-specific subroutines (\code{timestep} and \code{potential} to update the infiltration rate $i$ and the surface boundary conditions at cell \code{j,k}. 
%calls th subroutines (\code{potential} and \code{timestep}) to solve Richards equation. 
\code{timestep} solves Richards equation at cell \code{(j,k)} and returns the updated $H$, $\theta$ and $K$, which \code{source} uses to compute the infiltration rate $i$. \code{potential} is used to prescribe the boundary conditions. 

 The Richards equation solver is implemented separately for each grid cell, and the 3-dimensional $H$, $\theta$ and $K$  fields are saved as the common variables \code{r8H} (cm), \code{r8Theta}, and  \code{r8K} (cm/s), respectively, with dimensions (\code{nrow} $\times$ \code{ncol} $\times$ \code{nz}).\\ 

%%%% ADD POTENTIAL INFILTRATION

\noindent From Darcy's law, the infiltration rate $i$ (cm/s) is computed as:
$$ i =  K \bigg(\frac{\partial H}{\partial z} + 1\bigg ) $$
which corresponds to \code{r8kt*((hdum(nz)-hdum(nz-1))/dz+1)} in \code{source}.

\noindent  As an intermediate step, the depth is updated with: \\
\begin{center}
\code{znew=  zold + prate*100*dt - r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)*dt } 	
\end{center}
where \code{prate}  rainfall has been converted to cm/s.
 \code{winflt} = $p-i$  is then computed as:
\begin{center}
 \code{winflt = (znew - zold)/dt/100.} 	
\end{center}

%Note that \code{znew} is computed as a separate step for code readability, and things could be simplified to: \code{winflt = prate*100 - r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)} .
	
 

\subsection{\code{timestep}: the Richards equation subroutine }

Richards equation is solved by the \code{timestep} subroutine, which is called from \code{source}.
	
\subsubsection*{timestep inputs and outputs }
The inputs are \code{hnp1m, thetan}, which are the initial conditions to the Richards eqn solver (\code{hdum,thetadum} in the source subroutine, which calls \code{timestep}).  
The outputs are  \code{hnp1mp1,r8thetanp1m,r8knp1mp1}, which are  $H$, $\theta$ and $K$ at the following timestep (after dt\_r  time elapsed).


%$ i =  K (\frac{\partial H}{\partial z} + 1) $, which corresponds in the Fortran code to \code{ r8kt*( (hdum(nz) - hdum(nz-1))/dz + 1)}. 

When the soil is flagged as saturated,  the surface flux is set to $K$ at the surface, which should be very close to saturated (\code{flux  = - r8knp1m(nz)}).  This is achieved by adjusting the value of $H$ at node (nz-1):
\begin{center}
\code{hnp1mp1(nz-1) = hnp1mp1(nz) + dz + flux*dz/r8knp1m(nz-1)}	
\end{center}

Note: this approach should be treated with caution.  Is was designed for the use case of a fixed intensity rain storm, in which a uniform wetting front would arise.  It is not meant for variable rainfall cases.

\subsubsection*{Stop tolerance }
\code{stop\_tol0} is the stop tolerance specified in the input \code{params.dat}, with default value \code{stop\_tol0 = .01}.  
\code{stop\_tol} is reset to the original \code{stop\_tol0}  at the beginning of each Richards solver timestep.  The convergence tolerance  is relaxed if the Richards solver fails to converge within a specified number of iterations (default = 100).



\subsubsection*{Potential infiltration}

The subroutine \code{potential} is used to compute the potential infiltration rate $PI$, defined as the infiltration that would be observed for a surface boundary condition of $H=0$. 
Potential infiltration is computed when there is rain but no ponding, and returns the potential infiltration rate, defined as the infiltration rate that would occur with $H=0$ at the surface.  



%\subsection{Source subroutine variables}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \code{isetflux} (common) specifies the boundary condition for the Richards equation solver.  \\[.2cm]
%	 \code{isetflux} = 1 if the surface flux is specified: \code{flux = 0} in case 3 (no rain and no ponding), and \code{flux = prate} in case 2 (rain and no ponding).\\[.2cm]
%	 \code{isetflux} = 0 if the surface H is specified (Dirichlet). If there is ponding (case 4), the surface boundary condition is $H$=$h$. 
%	\item \code{flux} is the surface flux (cm/s).  \code{flux} is a common variable defined in \code{source}, and used by \code{timestep}  if \code{isetflux=1}. 
%
%	\item \code{htop}: Upper boundary condition for fixed $H$ boundary condition (\code{isetflux=1}).

\section{Appendix B: Input and output files, illustrated with a 2$\times$2 grid example}



%\code{nop(1,1,:) = [1,4,5,2]} means that cell (1,1) is bounded by nodes \code{n1=1,n2=4,n3=5,n4=2}, starting from the lower left node \code{n1} moving counterclockwise.
% \code{itype(j,k,2)=1, itype(j,k,3)=4}, means that cell \code{(j,k)} has a closed boundary at position 2 (right) and a subcritical influx boundary at position 3 (top). See Figure	 \ref{nodes}.			
%	
	 

To illustrate the grid set-up, example input files are included here for the 2x2 grid example.  Note that while the SVE-R model Fortran code does not assume a  rectangular grid, the provided Python code and sample input files do assume a rectangular grid. 
 Figure \ref{2by2} shows the cell center and node indices for the example grid, and Figure \ref{2by2boundary} shows the boundaries, which are a fixed-flux subcritical boundary at the top of the hill, closed/wall lateral boundaries, and an open boundary at the bottom of the hill.

\subsection{params.dat}

Sample \code{params.dat} files can be found in the \code{input} directories of the examples.  The parameters specified in \code{params.dat} are:
  
\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{grav} : acceleration due to gravity.
	\item \code{dt} : SVE timestep (\code{dt} is labeled \code{dt\_sw} in the Python code). 
	\item \code{tmax} : maximum time until the simulation ends.
	\item \code{tr} : rain duration in seconds (\code{tr} is labeled \code{t\_rain} in the Python code). 
	\item \code{prate} : rain intensity in m/s.
	\item \code{nt} :  number of time steps  (\code{tmax/dt})
	\item \code{epsh} : depth threshold to solve the SVE momentum equations.
	\item \code{beta} : value of beta in limitr subroutine.
	\item \code{nprt} : frequency f which the SVE-R output fields are saved: \code{nprt= dt\_p}.  Note: the hydrograph is saved every second.
	\item \code{iscale} : ratio of SVE to Richards equation timestep durations.
	\item \code{stop\_tol} : convergence criteria for Richards equation solver (default = 0.01).
	\item \code{h0, u0, v0} : initial depth, \code{u}, and \code{v} (defaults = 0).
	\item \code{r8mV,r8etaV, r8alphaV} : roughness parameters $m$, $\eta$ and $\alpha$ for vegetated cells. 
	\item \code{r8mB,r8etaB, r8alphaB} : roughness parameters $m$, $\eta$ and $\alpha$ for bare cells. 
	\item \code{jveg, kveg} : \code{j, k} indices of a vegetated cell for which the soil profile ($H$ and $\theta$) is saved every \code{nprt} timesteps.
	\item \code{jbare, kbare} : \code{j, k} indices of a bare soil cell for which the soil profile ($H$ and $\theta$) is saved every \code{nprt} timesteps.
	\item \code{tsat\_min} : Minimum time until the soil is allowed to ``sarturate'' (default =0).
\end{itemize}



 
% Following this, 
% the following rows record: 
% the number of columns and rows, and, for each column, 
% the beginning and final row  (i.e. \code{kbeg = 1} and \code{kend = nrow}.
%  
\subsection{boundary.dat}

\code{boundary.dat} specifies the boundary cell locations, types and orientations.  
For each boundary cell location (\code{j,k} indices), the number of boundary faces (\code{inum}), types (\code{itype}) and orientations (\code{ipos}) must be specified.
\code{boundary.dat} also lists any fixed boundary condition cells (\code{fix}) and the relevant primitive variables ($h$, $U$ and/or $V$, depending on the boundary type).

Provided boundary types are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \code{itype} = 1 for a closed boundary
	\item  \code{itype} = 0 for an open boundary
	\item  \code{itype} = 4 for 	 a subcritical inflow boundary
	\item  \code{itype} = 5 for a supercritical influx boundary
 \end{itemize}
 
For a subcritical inflow boundary,  the normal depth is computed  with Manning's equation with $n=0.1$.  
The input parameter \code{influx} is specified in unis m$^2$/s, which can be related to the rainfall rate (in cm/hr) as: $p$ = $q\cdot 3.6e5/L_y $ (cm/hr), or  \code{influx}  $q = p\cdot L_y/3.6e5$  (m$^2$/s).


Below is a sample \code{boundary.dat} for the 2x2 grid example, for which every cell is a boundary cell. 
The first two rows contain the number of boundary cells, defined as a grid cell with one or more boundaries.
The array on lines 3-7 show the (j,k) indices for each boundary cell, the number of boundaries associated with that cell, and boundary type of each boundary cell.

\subsection{coords.dat}

In the two rows specify the number of nodes (\code{npt}) and the number of cells (\code{ne}).  The remaining rows list the x,y,z coordinates at the nodes, in order of node number. Below is an example \code{coords.dat} file for the 2$\times$2 exampleg rid.

\subsection{vanG.dat}

\code{vanG.dat} specifies the soil dimensions, van Genuchten parameters and initial $H$ profile, independently for vegetated and bare soil cells (Note: all vegetated cells have the same parameters and ICs, and likewise for the bare soil cells).   See example below from the 2$\times$2 grid example.
The first two rows specify the soil depth (\code{zmax}) and soil layer thickness (\code{dz}), and the second two rows specify the number of soil grid points (soil layers + 1).   
Following this, the soil parameters and initial $H$ for the vegetated cells are listed for each soil layer in order of decreasing soil depth (the first row is the lowest layer of the soil column).   This format is repeated for the bare soil cells.   
From left to right, the columns are: 
	$\alpha$,$\theta_S$,$\theta_R$, $\lambda$, $K_s$, $H_i$, where $\lambda =  n-1 $ in Equation \ref{vanG_eqn} and $H_i$ is initialize with an equilibrium soil moisture profile.
